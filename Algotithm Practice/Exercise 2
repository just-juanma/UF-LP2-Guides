a.
We know that:
- A[1,...,n] 
- i < j (Example: 0 < 1)
- A[i] > A[j] (Example: A[0] = 1 > A[1] = 0)
- (i,j) is a reverse of A (Example: (A[i],A[j]) = (1, 0))

If we have:
- A[2,3,8,6,1]
Take the first two nums (i = 0, j = 1)
- i < j -> 0 < 1
- A[i] > A[j] (2 > 3 its not true, so its not a reverse)
In conclusion, we must find a pair for a value of j that is less than 2

Let's see when i = 0 and j = 4
- i < j -> 0 < 4
- A[i] > A[j] -> 2 > 1
So, we find de first reverse -> (0,4)
In case you don't have more numbers lower than A[i] (2), we go to the next numbers

i = 1 and j = 4
- i < j -> 1 < 4
- A[i] > A[j] -> 4 > 1
Another pair: (1,4)

i = 2 and j = 3
- i < j -> 2 < 3
- A[i] > A[j] -> 8 > 6
Another pair: (2,3)

i = 2 and j = 4
- i < j -> 2 < 4
- A[i] > A[j] -> 8 > 1
Another pair: (2,4)

i = 3 and j = 4
- i < j -> 3 < 4
- A[i] > A[j] -> 6 > 1
Another pair: (3,4)

b. If we have A = { 1, 2, ..., n } -> A = { k, ..., k + n } (taking n as an index)
The vector with the largest number of investments will be the one that is ordered from largest to smallest values
Knowing this, we say with k = 0 (example):
- k < k + n -> 0 < n
- A[k] > A[k + n] -> A[0] > A[n]
So the pairs will be (from 1 to n) (0, n) -> n combinations for i = 0

But, this is for the first element, and for the second there will be n - 1 combinations (i = 1)
And so on until n = 1 (base case).
However, the vector with the largest number of inversions will be Î£ r (from 0 to n)
