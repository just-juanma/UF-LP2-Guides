for i = 1 to n
 [...]
 if candidate i it's better than best
 best = i
 [...]
 
 a. Will be hired 1 time when the first candidate is the best.
 According to the probability distribution in an infinite equiprobable space -> P(best) = 1/n
 
 b. What is the probability that the candidates are in the ascending order? taking into account that each candidate is a separate case (independent of each other), we consider P(hire N times) = 1/n
