 if candidate i it's better than best
 best = i

 a. Will be hired 1 time when the first candidate is the best.
 According to the probability distribution in an infinite equiprobable space -> P(best) = 1/N
 
 b. To contract N times, it has to be ordered from highest to lowest. Then, it should have the following distribution: { N, N - 1, ... }
 Assuming { 4,3,2,1 }:
 The probability of hiring the first one (the one we are interested in) is 1/n. To hire the second one would be 1/n, but let's take into account that we are not replacing, so we are left with 1/n-1.
 We will follow this algorithm until the end, and its result will be multiplied among all. Having P(hire N times) = 1/N * 1/N-1...
 Reducing it to P(hire N times) = 1/N!
