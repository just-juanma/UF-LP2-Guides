## Development of the guides <a name="description"></a>

The first guide was made by implementing recursion in the "recursion" project. The purpose is to demonstrate that using this method promises to obtain a "tidier" but less efficient code, since a waste of unnecessary resources occurs. However, in some situations it can be of great importance to have this method in mind.

## How to Install and Run the Project <a name="howto"></a>

To use the project, we debug it using Visual Studio 2022 Community in C# language. We understand that depending on the version of this IDE there may be conflicts.

## Considerations <a name="considerations"></a>

This repository does not seek to have perfect error control, and yet it relies heavily on main input. That is why the care that the user must take is the values that are entered.

## License <a name="license"></a>
This Practical Work is subject to GPL-3.0 license, more information in the LICENSE.md file.
